<p>The plateau pocket gopher, <i>Cratogeomys castanops</i>, inhabits open
lands from southeastern Colorado southward onto the Mexican
Plateau as far south as southern San Luis Potos&iacute; and southeastern
Zacatecas and southeastward to the Coastal Plain of northern Tamaulipas.
This species occurs at elevations from as low as 26 feet at
Matamoras in Tamaulipas to as high as 8700 feet in valleys of south-eastern
Coahuila. In 1934, Nelson and Goldman (Proc. Biol. Soc.
Washington, 47:135-154, June 13, 1934) revised the genus
<i>Cratogeomys</i> and decided that six subspecies of <i>C. castanops</i> occurred
in Coahuila. In the present account, we describe four
previously unknown subspecies from Coahuila, exclude from the
state two others recorded from there by Nelson and Goldman, and
show that three others named previously from adjacent Mexican
states do occur in Coahuila. This makes eleven subspecies now
known from that state. From Coahuila Nelson and Goldman had
35 study specimens of <i>C. castanops</i> from seven localities and we
have had 234 specimens from 63 localities. Consequently we have
been able to define with greater certainty, than formerly was possible,
the geographic distribution of <i>C. castanops</i> in this Mexican
state and similarly analyze more completely the geographic variation.</p>

<p>Coahuila is near the center of the geographic range of <i>C. castanops</i>.
The occurrence of 11 subspecies within the state seems to be
the result of partial or perhaps, in some cases, total isolation of populations
of <i>C. castanops</i> because of the highly dissected topography
and the variability of the soil. <i>Cratogeomys castanops</i> is a sedentary
animal preferring open plains mantled by suitable soils, preferably
sandy in texture, in which the animals can dig their elaborate
underground systems of runways. Thin soils of hard texture and
rocky soils do not offer optimum habitat for <i>C. castanops</i>, and the
animals usually are absent or uncommon in such situations. Desert
mountains with their thin rocky soils, elevated passes, perpendicular
rocky cliffs, and stands of oaks and conifers at higher elevations
present impassable barriers for pocket gophers of this species. The
R&iacute;o Grande, bordering Coahuila to the north, in many places flowing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
through steep-walled ca&ntilde;ons, also seems to be a barrier that this
fossorial rodent does not cross; distinct subspecies occur on the two
sides of the river directly opposite each other (also see Nelson and
Goldman, <i>op. cit.</i>: 143). Smaller streams, such as the R&iacute;o Salado,
R&iacute;o Nazas and R&iacute;o Salinas, seem to be unimportant barriers to the
passage of these pocket gophers. The food supply of <i>C. castanops</i>
seems adequate in most situations and consequently food is unimportant
in governing the distribution of this species. Principal foods
of <i>C. castanops</i> are fleshy tuberous roots of well-distributed desert
shrubs, but in the valleys of the high mountains of southeastern
Coahuila, where desert shrubs are absent, roots and leaves of low-growing
forbs are eaten.</p>

<p>Three distinct habitats for <i>C. castanops</i> occur in Coahuila. The
state is crossed by a series of mostly impassable, mountainous ridges
beginning at the northwestern boundary at the Ca&ntilde;on de Boquillas
on the R&iacute;o Grande and extending southeastward to the east-central
border. This divides Coahuila into a more humid and less elevated
northeastern area which is an inland extension westward of the
Coastal Plain and a more arid and higher western and southern
area which is a part of the "Mesa del Norte" of the Mexican Plateau.
In the extreme southeast the still higher elevated plains and intermontane
valleys within the Sierra Madre Oriental afford a third
habitat for populations of this species. The subspecies of these
pocket gophers found in any one of these three habitats show greater
affinity to each other than they do to any subspecies found in the
other habitats.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, populations of <i>C. castanops</i> from northeastern
Coahuila are related, as a group, in color and cranial features.
Partial isolation of subspecies in this area results chiefly from discontinuity
of suitable soils rather than from topography. These
pocket gophers occur most commonly in the deep, sandy soils which
are found along streams, especially where farm lands are irrigated.
In western and southern Coahuila, mountains extending in both
north-south and east-west directions act as partial barriers to the
passage of <i>C. castanops</i>. Within this large area, pocket gophers
occur in desert basins many of which are enclosed on two or more
sides by mountains. Even so, with the exception of the smaller <i>C.
c. consitus</i> of northwestern Coahuila, all known subspecies occurring
at lower elevations in the western and southern part of the state
show close relationships in color and cranial features. Those subspecies
in the higher parts of southeastern Coahuila by their small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
size and dark color reflect to a high degree their isolation in an
elevated habitat.</p>

<p>Males of <i>C. castanops</i> differ greatly from females of equal age;
consequently animals of the same sex, as well as of the same age,
are used herein for taxonomic comparisons. Since, of any given
age-group, females show less individual variation than do males, we
have relied more on the characteristics of the females in this taxonomic
study. Only specimens taken at approximately the same
times of the year have been compared for color of pelage. Capitalized
color terms are those of Ridgway, Color Standards and Color
Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912. Specimens made available
through the courtesy of the authorities of the Biological Surveys Collection
of the United States National Museum are indicated in the
accounts of subspecies as BSC; other specimens listed are in the
collection of the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History.
Assistance with field work is acknowledged from the Kansas University
Endowment Association and the National Science Foundation.</p>

<p>In any one of the lists of "Specimens examined" beyond, the order
of arrangement of the localities is from north to south. Those localities
listed in Roman type are represented on the distribution map
(<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) by blacked-in circles. Each of several circles covers
two or more localities because the localities are close together. In
any such instance the northernmost place is listed in Roman type
and the names of the other places follow in Italic type. Measurements
in millimeters are given in <a href="#tbl1">table 1</a> for females and in <a href="#tbl2">table 2</a>

<i>Comparisons.</i>--From topotypes of <i>Cratogeomys castanops angusticeps</i> Nelson
and Goldman, found to the north and east across the R&iacute;o Grande in Texas,
<i>convexus</i> differs in: Body larger; upper parts more reddish, especially on sides;
skull with zygomata less heavy, nasals broader, pterygoids smaller, maxillary
teeth larger. For comparisons of <i>convexus</i> with the subspecies of <i>C. castanops</i>
found to the west, south and southeast, see accounts of the subspecies to follow.</p>

<div class="remarks"><p><i>Remarks.</i>--The geographic range of <i>convexus</i> is restricted, being
bounded on the west and southwest by mountains, especially
the Serran&iacute;as del Burro, and on the north and east by the R&iacute;o
Grande. The range of the subspecies found to the southeast may
not be continuous with that of <i>convexus</i>. At least, in the area between
Villa Acu&ntilde;a and Piedras Negras, along the R&iacute;o Grande, no
specimens were obtained and no sign was observed. We suspect
that in this area the species occurs only locally if at all.</p>

<p>A specimen taken near the R&iacute;o Grande in Coahuila, opposite
Samuels, Texas, and assigned to <i>Cratogeomys castanops clarkii</i> by
Nelson and Goldman (op. cit.:140), has been examined by us and
is referable to <i>convexus</i>. This specimen is typical of <i>convexus</i> except
for the lesser inflation of the mastoid bullae and tympanic
bullae. Conspicuous differences between <i>convexus</i> and <i>angusticeps</i>
indicate that the R&iacute;o Grande is an effective barrier to passage by
these rodents.</p></div>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>--Body medium for the species (see <a href="#tbl1">tables 1 and 2</a>); tail long;
hind foot small; upper parts Light Ochraceous-Buff (in summer pelage) and
Orange-Buff (in winter pelage), bases of hairs Plumbeous; underparts white
to pale buffy; skull small, broad and slightly convex in dorsal outline; zygomata
widely flaring; palate short; rostrum short; nasals short; mastoid and tympanic
bullae inflated; basioccipital with lateral edges parallel; maxillary teeth small.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>--From <i>Cratogeomys castanops convexus</i>, found to the north,
<i>bullatus</i> differs in: Hind foot shorter; skull much broader in relation to length;
rostrum narrower but, relative to length of skull, wider; tympanic bullae
slightly more inflated; incisors and maxillary teeth smaller. From topotypes of
<i>Cratogeomys castanops angusticeps</i>, found across the R&iacute;o Grande and upstream
from localities where <i>bullatus</i> is known to occur, <i>bullatus</i> differs in: Body
slightly smaller; color paler, especially on sides; skull shorter and broader;
rostrum shorter and broader; nasals shorter; mastoid and tympanic bullae more
inflated; maxillary teeth smaller. For comparisons of <i>bullatus</i> with the subspecies
of <i>C. castanops</i> found to the west and south, see accounts of the subspecies
to follow.</p>

<div class="remarks"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
<i>Remarks.</i>--<i>Cratogeomys castanops bullatus</i> in small size resembles
<i>C. c. tamaulipensis</i> Nelson and Goldman of the lower R&iacute;o
Grande Valley in Tamaulipas, but the two differ markedly in cranial
features. <i>Cratogeomys c. bullatus</i> is smaller than <i>convexus</i> but
these two subspecies resemble each other in color and cranial characters.
Both have an arched skull, inflated mastoid and tympanic
bullae, short nasals, and a short rostrum. Comparison of <i>bullatus</i>
with <i>angusticeps</i>, which occurs across the R&iacute;o Grande but not directly
opposite the range of <i>bullatus</i>, indicates that these two subspecies
are less closely related than <i>bullatus</i> is to <i>tamaulipensis</i> and
<i>convexus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cratogeomys castanops bullatus</i> is especially common in sandy
soils in the vicinity of Nava where the mounds were in fallow irrigated
fields and other open places between extensive live oak
thickets. South and west of the R&iacute;o Grande the animals were less
abundant and lived in heavier soils usually as individuals or in small
groups. Specimens were taken at elevations from as low as 800 feet
to as high as 2,000 feet.</p></div>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>--Total, 24, from: 2 mi. S and 6-1/2 mi. E Nava, 810 ft.,

<p><i>Distribution.</i>--Extreme northeastern Coahuila from the vicinity of Presa
Don Martin southward into northwestern Neuvo Le&oacute;n in the valley of the R&iacute;o
Salado and its tributaries at least as far south as the vicinity of Vallecillo (see
<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>--Body large for species (see <a href="#tbl1">tables 1 and 2</a>); hind foot short;
upper parts Apricot Buff (in fresh summer pelage) and Salmon-Buff strongly
mixed with black (in fresh winter pelage); underparts Light Ochraceous-Buff;
skull large, especially in females, and broad; zygomatic arches widely flaring;
palate long; rostrum broad; nasals long; mastoid and tympanic bullae not conspicuously
inflated; incisors narrow; maxillary teeth large.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>--From <i>Cratogeomys castanops bullatus</i> found to the north,
<i>ustulatus</i> differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; upper parts darker, more rufous
and less buffy; skull larger, especially in palate, nasals, and rostrum; zygomata
more widely flaring; tympanic bullae less inflated; incisors slightly larger; maxillary
teeth larger. From topotypes of <i>Cratogeomys castanops tamaulipensis</i>
found to the southeast, <i>ustulatus</i> differs in: Body larger; upper parts, in winter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
pelage, darker, more rufous and less buffy; underparts paler; skull larger, especially
in palate, rostrum and nasals; zygomata more widely flaring; tympanic
bullae more inflated; pterygoids larger; basioccipital narrower, its sides parallel
instead of convex; maxillary teeth smaller. From <i>Cratogeomys castanops subsimus</i>,
found to the southwest, <i>ustulatus</i> differs in: Tail shorter; hind foot
smaller; upper parts darker, more rufous and less pinkish-buff; skull shorter;
zygomata less widely flaring; palate shorter; rostrum averaging slightly narrower;
nasals shorter; incisors narrower; maxillary teeth slightly smaller. For comparison
of <i>ustulatus</i> with the subspecies of <i>C. castanops</i> to the southwest, see account
of that subspecies to follow.</p>

<div class="remarks"><p><i>Remarks.</i>--<i>Cratogeomys castanops ustulatus</i> is a large-sized pocket
gopher with a relatively larger, skull. In size of skull, <i>ustulatus</i> is
exceeded only by <i>C. c. subsimus</i> found beyond the mountains in the
southern part of Coahuila. In size, <i>ustulatus</i> differs so markedly
from <i>bullatus</i> that the two can be distinguished easily by this feature
alone. The skull of <i>C. c. convexus</i> approaches that of <i>ustulatus</i> in
size, but is smaller in all respects, save breadth of rostrum.</p>

<p>This pocket gopher is found commonly along the R&iacute;o Salado and
its watershed. Fallow cotton fields in the vicinity of Anahuac
[= Rodr&iacute;ques], Nuevo Le&oacute;n, are preferred living places. This subspecies
was found at elevations as high as 1000 feet and as low as
600 feet.</p></div>

<div class="remarks"><p><i>Remarks.</i>--<i>Cratogeomys castanops jucundus</i> is large, exceeding
subsimus in dimensions of the body, but differing from <i>subsimus</i> in
relatively smaller skull. Passage to the north and northeast by
<i>jucundus</i> is at least partly blocked by inhospitable mountainous
country; the resulting semi-isolation may be one reason for the distinctive
characteristics of <i>jucundus</i> compared with those of <i>bullatus</i>
and <i>ustulatus</i>. Two specimens from Monclova, assigned to <i>tamaulipensis</i>
by Nelson and Goldman (op. cit.:142), are here referred to
<i>jucundus</i> on the basis of cranial characters and size.</p>

<p>Specimens were trapped in fallow irrigated fields in the vicinity
of Monclova. Others were taken in deep soils in desert flats.</p></div>

tympanic bullae less inflated; maxillary teeth larger.</p>

<div class="remarks"><p><i>Remarks.</i>--<i>Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus</i> is limited to the
Llano de Ocampo, an elevated, desert plain surrounded on three
sides, west, south and east, by higher mountainous country which
seems to bar the passage of this rodent. On the eastern side this
barrier extends north to the very banks of the R&iacute;o Grande in the
Ca&ntilde;on de Boquillas. This subspecies, therefore, is in contact with
other populations of <i>Cratogeomys</i> only to the north and northwest.
This subspecies is well characterized by size, color and cranial characteristics.</p>

<p><i>Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus</i> is not abundant; groups of
mounds constructed by one or a few individuals were found in
widely separated places. Mounds were often small, appeared old
and, in other ways, were inconspicuous on arid flats. The animals
were taken at elevations as low as 3250 feet and as high as 4150 feet.</p></div>

in northwestern Coahuila and small colonies are widely scattered.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>--Desert plains of southwestern Coahuila and northeastern
Durango (see <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>--<i>Cratogeomys castanops excelsus</i> is characterized by large
size and pale color; it is the palest subspecies of <i>C. castanops</i>. Of adjacent subspecies,
excelsus most closely resembles <i>C. c. subsimus</i> which occurs to the east
and resembles least <i>C. c. consitus</i>, which occurs to the northwest.</p>

<p>From <i>Cratogeomys castanops subsimus</i>, found to the east, <i>excelsus</i> differs
in: Body averaging slightly larger; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler,
more light buffy and less yellowish; skull smaller; palate especially shorter;
rostrum narrower; nasals shorter; incisors slightly smaller; maxillary tooth-row
shorter. Compared with topotypes of <i>C. c. goldmani</i>, found to the south,
<i>excelsus</i> differs in: Body larger; hind foot smaller; upper parts in winter pelage
paler, more buffy and less rufous; skull larger; zygomata more widely flaring;
rostrum broader; nasals shorter; tympanic bullae larger and more inflated;
maxillary teeth larger.</p>

<p>Specimens of <i>excelsus</i> from the vicinity of Torre&oacute;n, in southwestern Coahuila,
are slightly smaller in cranial dimensions than more typical examples of the subspecies.
In small size, at least, these specimens show some resemblance to
<i>goldmani</i> to the south. The range of <i>excelsus</i> approaches that of <i>C. c. consitus</i>
in west-central Coahuila (see <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), but no evidence of intergradation between
these two subspecies could be ascertained. For comparison of <i>excelsus</i>
with <i>consitus</i>, see account of the latter.</p>

<div class="remarks"><p><i>Remarks.</i>--<i>Cratogeomys castanops excelsus</i> lives in the deep soils
of the arid interior basin of southwestern Coahuila and adjacent
parts of Durango. This animal is common in the cultivated areas
in, and in the vicinity of, the formerly extensive Laguna de Mayr&aacute;n.
East of this laguna the land becomes progressively higher, and <i>C.

<div class="remarks"><p><i>Remarks.</i>--<i>Cratogeomys castanops subsimus</i> is the largest known
subspecies of the species in cranial dimensions, but is exceeded in
size of body by <i>C. c. jucundus</i> to the north. Of adjacent subspecies,
<i>subsimus</i> is the most closely related to <i>excelsus</i> and shows little or
no relationship to the smaller and darker <i>C. c. subnubilus</i> and <i>C. c.
planifrons</i>, which are found at higher elevations to the south and
southeast, respectively. Movements by <i>subsimus</i> to the north, east,
and south are barred by inhospitable mountains. Specimens of
<i>subsimus</i> from the northeastern part of its range are larger and
darker than other specimens assigned to this subspecies. An adult
female, assigned to <i>subsimus</i>, from the vicinity of Santa Rosa is
noticeably smaller and paler than typical specimens of this subspecies.</p>

<p><i>Cratogeomys castanops subsimus</i> occurs in scattered colonies in
sandy soils principally in the upper drainage of the R&iacute;o Salinas.
Specimens have also been taken from the foothills of the Sierra
Madre Oriental and westward on the elevated desert plains.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
